Odin Project - a simple JS game

First, I had to create a rock, paper, scissors game that was only played with a prompt pop up. This project code can be viewed in the "script.js" file. 

After I created this game, I wanted to create a better user interface where the user selected an input. I wanted to design something that was easy to understand, simple, and looked kind of modern. There's a figma file to see the design (and PNG). 

I created a main function for the game called gameTurn() which is a simple if sequence. The sequence is broken up into if computer wins, if player wins, and then ends after a player gets to 5 which triggers the helper function endGame().
